# Hyperion Dev Portfolio Projects

This is a collection of some of the additional tasks I have been working on alongside my main Hyperion Dev SE Bootcamp Tasks.

### Number Guesser Game

This program implements a number guessing game with user accounts and high-score tracking. It utilizes file I/O to read and write user information and high scores, employing dictionaries to store username-password pairs and user high scores. The script employs a while-loop structure for user interaction, prompting users to log in or create an account, handling authentication through username and password input. High scores are updated and displayed, and users can choose to play again or log out, with all data permanently saved to text files.

### Log Manager

This Python code is a shipment log management program. Key features include reading, editing, and formatting logs. It offers search options (by date, type, reference number, location, goods type) and allows users to add new logs. The program is menu-driven, employing file handling, data manipulation, and user input validation

### PawsNCart

Program which simulates an online shopping cart. This provides users with a basic menu and gives them the option to add items to their cart, remove items, view the current total cost of their cart, or ‘checkout’ and exit the program. Also uses defensive programming techniques to ensure the user enters valid inputs.

### Simple Scribe

Program which simulates a text formatting tool, and returns an output which can be copied and pasted into a markdown file to be formatted as desired.
<br> Current functionality includes:
* Adding headings, sub headings and main body text to the file.
* Add text in **Bold** or *Italic* 
* Insert a new paragraph using a line space
* Edit text already in the file
* Viewing and print the output for copying

Currently working on adding functionality for inserting bullet points and tables.

### Input Validator<br>

Program which takes in user input of their details and verifies they are in the correct format. Current functionality includes first and last name, and phone number. Future functionality will include email address and postal address.
